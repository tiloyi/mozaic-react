## About Mozaic Design System

**Mozaic** is an inner-source design system built by [Adeo](https://www.adeo.com/), to reinforce team's delivery time, improve quality of deliverables and thus help set up a coherent customer experience within the digital interfaces of the group's brands.

You can learn more about **Mozaic** vision and guidelines by visiting our documentation website [ here](https://mozaic.adeo.cloud/).

## Contributing

Developers interested in contributing should read the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/adeo/mozaic-design-system/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and the Contribution Guide (coming soon).

### Getting started

To run the documentation locally, you can do the following:

```shell

Congratulations, `Storybook` is running on [http://localhost:6006/](http://localhost:6006/). :rocket:

[Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/docs/vue/get-started/introduction) acts as our documentation. Furthermore, it is really useful during development. It allows to play with props and see how our components react to it.

#### This repository

This repository contains the following elements:

-   In the `.storybook` folder, all the **Storybook** configuration.
-   In `src`, the code, test and stories of the **Mozaic-React components** and the associated configuration
